Arduino based Obstavle avoider:
File name: Obstacle_Avoider_W_HCSR04_Servo_DCMotor
File Size: 2kb

Instruments used:
1. Arduino UNO board 
2.Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
3.Servo motor (SG90)
4.Two DC motor's


Details:
	Program Code:
		The program code for the following obstacle avoider is not yet complete as per the design. It is not yet configured to change its direction on encountering 
	an obstacle,the code for the change of DC motion is yet to be written.
		The present code can only work in a straight line till it encounters an obstacle at a minimum distance of 9cm, after which the DC motors stop rotating and 
	servo motor rotates by180 degrees.

About Circuit diagram:
	The abpve mentioned instruments have been arranged as shown in the circuit diagram.
